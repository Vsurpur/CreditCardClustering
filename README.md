# CreditCardClustering
### Problem Statement
Create a clustering model to credit card categorize the dataset into appropriate cluster. Context: This case requires to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy. The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral
variables.

I have made a Clustering Model to classify the customers of a credit card company into different clusters based on their spending habits. 
For this I have used K-Means module and PCA to reduce dimensions.
